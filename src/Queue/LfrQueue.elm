module Queue.LfrQueue exposing (Queue, deq, empty, enq, isEmpty, peek, size)

{-| Front-Rear List Queue

LfrQueue is a FIFO queue represented with a pair of lists, front and rear.
It is one of the fastest queue implementations known.
Invariants:

  - f is [] iff r is []

See 5.2 Queues p.42 and Figure 5.2 A common implementation of purely functional queues p.43.
